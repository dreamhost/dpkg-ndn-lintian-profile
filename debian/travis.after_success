# This is a scriptlet, intended to be invoked in .travis.yml's "after_success"
# section.
#
# We run:
#
#   on branch master
#   not on pull requests
#
# Our purpose is to "deploy" a passing build to launchpad, such that it can be
# automagically built by a source recipe.  This requires a little magic,
# however, as we need a ssh keypair with access to push to the bzr branch,
# git-bzr-ng installed, etc, etc.
#
# Note: the ssh keypair here is *only* decrypted by travis -- indeed, can only
# be decrypted by them -- and then never on jobs initiated by pull requests.
# See: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/
